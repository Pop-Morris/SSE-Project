## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20.18.1 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A BigCommerce store with API credentials
- ngrok (for webhook testing)

## Setup Steps

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pop-Morris/SSE-Project.git
   cd SSE-Project
   cd bigcommerce-automation
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install ngrok**
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```
   - Sign up for a free ngrok account at https://ngrok.com
   - Get your authtoken from the ngrok dashboard
   - Configure ngrok with your authtoken:
     ```bash
     ngrok config add-authtoken your_auth_token
     ```
   - This command updates the authtoken property in your ngrok configuration file - allowing you to start your local server
   - In a separate terminal, start your ngrok server. You can do this with a static server or a randomly generated one.
   - For a static server:
     ```bash
     ngrok http --url={your_unique_ngrok_url} 3000
     ```
     EXAMPLE:
     ```bash
     ngrok http --url=mallard-smashing-blatantly.ngrok-free.app 3000
     ```
   - Note that your unique ngrok URL is generated and displayed on the ngrok dashboard once logged in
   - For a random URL:
     ```bash
     npx ngrok http 3000
     ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   ```

   Create a `.env.local` file with your BigCommerce credentials:
   ```
   BigCommerce API Credentials,
   BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH=your_store_hash
   BIGCOMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_ID=keep_blank
   BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_SECRET=keep_blank
 

   Webhook Configuration,
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:3000/

   NGROK Tunnel URL,
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL={your_ngrok_tunnel_url}

   EXAMPLE_DO_NOT_COPY:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=https://mallard-smashing-blatantly.ngrok-free.app
   ```

5. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

    These commands set up your local SQLite database:
   - `prisma generate` creates the Prisma Client based on your schema
   - `prisma migrate dev` creates and applies the initial database migration, creating the necessary tables for workflows and activity logs

6. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Why ngrok?
ngrok is required because:
- BigCommerce needs to send webhooks to a public URL
- Your local development server (localhost) isn't accessible from the internet
- ngrok creates a secure tunnel to your localhost, making it accessible to BigCommerce
- This allows you to receive and test webhooks during local development

## Alternative to ngrok
If you can't use ngrok, you have a few options:
1. Deploy to a staging environment for testing
2. Use a different tunneling service (like localtunnel)

## Verifying Setup
To verify your setup is working correctly:
1. Ensure the development server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Check that ngrok is running and providing a valid HTTPS URL
3. Verify your BigCommerce credentials are correctly set in `.env.local`
4. Confirm the database migrations have been applied successfully
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/test-webhook
  - This webpage should return raw JSON that automatically creates a webhook for testing purposes
